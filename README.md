# LearningMachineLearning
This is an educational repository, with no intentions whatsoever of being used in production environments.
This repository is not optimized and it's most likely easy to break.

The implementations on the scratch folder are mine: they are correct, but probably not even close to perfect. My intention is creating an easy and understandable version of the algorithms, at the same time I learn them, to improve my comprehension of them and maybe help anyone that's reading this.

The implementations on the SkLearn folder are calls to the API of the library, they are only there in order to learn how to use the library.

In the comparisons folder, there are jupyter notebooks which call both mine and sklearn's implementations, and compare them to see how far i am from the library's solution.
