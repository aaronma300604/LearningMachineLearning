# LearningMachineLearning
This is an educational repository, with no intentions whatsoever of being used in production environments.
This repository is not optimized and it's most likely easy to break.

The implementations on the scratch folder are mine: they are correct, but probably not even close to perfect. My intention is creating an easy and understandable version of the algorithms, at the same time I learn them, to improve my comprehension of them and maybe help anyone that's reading this.


In the comparisons folder, there are jupyter notebooks which call both mine and sklearn's implementations, and compare them to see how far i am from the library's solution.  

In the datasets folder you will find all the datasets used in this projects, credits to their respective authors.
